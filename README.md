## Enterprise Computer Vision Platform for Warehouse Automation

**Triminds ObjectScanner** is an enterprise-grade AI-powered computer vision solution designed to identify, classify and count warehouse assets using standard Android devices.

Instead of relying on expensive specialized hardware, users can scan pallets, boxes, labels, QR Codes, barcodes, and warehouse objects directly from a smartphone. Captured information is processed locally or in the cloud using Artificial Intelligence and automatically integrated with enterprise systems.
